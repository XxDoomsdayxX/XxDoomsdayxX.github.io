                    Hello! My name is Darrell Walker, and I was born and raised in North Carolina where I grew up in town called Gastonia. I gradutaed High School in 2012 and
                    immediatley starting working in the blue collar field where I would gather a vast amount of life skills. In 2018 I enrolled in a job corps program at a
                    school called Oconaluftee Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center located in Cherokee, NC. There I learned many skills as an electrician during which I was sent to coloraodo
                    for an internship for the Forest Service, where I performed maintenance for the state campgrounds which also happens to be where I met my wife.
                    <br /><br />
                    I married in 2019 and we have one beautiful daughter together. In 2020 I decided to change my career path and pursue a career in technology which is something I've always been fasincated with.
                    I enrolled in a tech school called MyComputerCareer where I learned many skills in the IT field and gained several certifications in networking and security.
                    <br /><br />
                    Afterwards, I enrolled into <abbr title="Southern New Hampshire University">SNHU</abbr> to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering which was completed
                    in October of 2025. Now I seek to bring my ideas to life through hard work and alot of code.
